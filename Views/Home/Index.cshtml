             <h3>Brad Buller</h3>
             <p>I’m a gameplay programmer by day, and a gamer by night. I was always told to do what I love,
so I decided to make video games. I knew it was the right decision when every time I played a
game, I paused and tried to think of how every mechanic worked inside the game, and how all
the pieces fit together to make something fun. I love working closely alongside artist to get the
best possible outcome for their artistic vision. I just want to make things that make people
happy. I’ve used languages like C#, C++, Java, and Sarcasm. I’m not sure if the last one is
useful, but I think all programmers use it. Contact Email
